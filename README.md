iOSMapDemo
==========

MapKit and asynchronous network calls to the foursquare API

Note: To actually run the app, you need to get your API token from the
Foursquare API! It's really easy. Go to https://developer.foursquare.com, log
in, and find your oauth_token and you should be good to go! Just make sure you
fill it in at the top of PlacesMapViewController (there should be a warning
there).
